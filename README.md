ready for deployment after few configurations. 
This app uses Firebase as a backend service, as well as AWS SDK for an S3 bucket.

1) You need to create a user role in AWS and enter the credentials into the javascript files where it contains the certain S3 functions. Make sure when creating the S3 bucket to have it set to public permissions for the app to work.
2) Configure your Firebase and firestore credentials in the app
